insight into the activities of Karlsruhe in the framework of the ECCAR.
It further contains a detailed report on a specific ongoing measure
related to Commitment 1 of the 10-Point-Plan-of-Action (10PPA)
implemented in the city’s function as a democratic institution, in
level 2 of the report.
Completeness
All questions are answered and, where possible, interesting details
have been provided. Karlsruhe reports on its structural functioning,
its legal background and its expectations from and offers to the
network of ECCAR and its members expressing its high appreciation
for the network, its offers and its bodies. In level 2 of the report, an
extensive description of the city’s Round Table on Anti-Racism and
Anti-Discrimination is shared.

How many people in your city administration work on anti-racism / discrimination?
It's impossible to provide a specific number. The Round Table, as well as the Weeks Against Racism in
Karlsruhe, demonstrate a high level of activity in civil society.

Please describe the diversity in this group of people, i.e. the composition in terms of ethnicity, migratory
background, gender, disability, etc
A comprehensive description is hardly possible within this framework. The roundtable demonstrated
broad coverage, but people of color, potential victims of antisemitism and antigypsyism, are difficult to
reach and are therefore less represented. A broad group with various migration backgrounds, as well as
people with disabilities and other identity characteristics, is represented.

How many actions has your city implemented against racism since the last ECCAR report or since
becoming member of the network in case it is your first report?
The foundation of municipal anti-racism work was successfully expanded beyond the Cultural Office and
its cultural institutions to include other municipal departments and institutions close to the city, making it
significantly more effective – especially in the area of integration.
The Karlsruhe Anti-Discrimination Office, which was originally founded as a private organization, was
secured, expanded, and further professionalized by taking over responsibility for it from the Karlsruhe City
Youth Committee.
The "Karlsruhe Weeks Against Racism," which were held six times by the city between 2013 and 2019, were
successfully continued as the "International Weeks Against Racism in Karlsruhe" under the organization of
civil society volunteers even after the city withdrew from the overall organization thanks to the established
foundation and monetary and non-monetary support of the city, as well as the participation of individual
departments with program items – thus setting important priorities and building networks.
Awareness of the existence of racism and discrimination in all areas of "group-focused misanthropy," as
well as its threat to social cohesion, democratic identity, and social peace, increased significantly in the
city administration, urban institutions and societies, local politics, educational and higher education
institutions, and in large parts of civil society, leading to diverse and successful activities, declarations,
more fundamental measures, and the increasing networking of those involved and their activities.

Overall comment on the ACTION
Round Table on Anti-Racism and Anti-Discrimination
The SAC assesses the reported measure as good practice for the
reason of its:
•Relevance
•Consistency
•Persistence
•Effectiveness
•Adequacy
•Substantiveness
•Transferability
The SAC welcomes the detailed report. The SAC appreciates the report
as good practice first of all. It is a full-fledged study providing in-
depth analyses on what worked, what were the lessons learned in a
process that finally led to a result – the position paper against
discrimination – which is supported by a broad basis in the
administration and in civil society, deemed having a promising
perspective and providing the municipality with three fundamental
principles of non-racist behaviour. Further, the SAC assesses the
Action as being a good practice. The persons responsible
demonstrated patience and obviously applied the theory of change in
practice. The process, reaching out to some 200 individuals, was open
and needed negotiations among participants to define and realize
itself. The words of the rapporteurs make it clear:
It brought together key stakeholders from the administration, city-
related institutions and subsidiaries, as well as civil society, for the
first time in an organized manner to jointly develop a guiding
principle for a discrimination-sensitive and anti-racism urban society.
It is not the end, but the beginning of joint efforts and activities.
The position paper was the result of this very hard work. However, it
paid off, as evaluations show. The first part analyzes in detail the
effects of structural and institutional racism and discrimination and
shows how the city administration can perpetuate or reproduce
discriminatory practices through its structures. The second part
describes eight key areas of impact that define concrete goals and
time-bound measures to combat racism and discrimination. These
measures are intended to initiate structural changes and distribute
responsibility among various levels of administration and urban
society.
Three guiding principles form the basis of municipal anti-racism and
anti-discrimination work:
1. Nothing about us without us – The perspectives and experiences of
affected groups must be actively included, and their participation
ensured.
2. Focus on needs – Measures are geared to the concrete needs and
realities of marginalized people.
3. Representation makes a difference – The visibility and
participation of people with experience of racism in decision-making
processes must be ensured.
The SAC agrees with the rapporteurs who conclude:
if these principles are actually implemented – anti-racist perspectives
are continuously taken into account.
As a study on participatory processes in the field of anti-racism, the

Mittwoch, 6. August 202512/27

Following consultations in its committees in 2021, the Karlsruhe City Council commissioned the
administration to establish a "Round Table for Municipal Anti-Racism and Anti-Discrimination Work" (RT
ARAD). This round table was to develop an anti-racism and anti-discrimination mission statement for
Karlsruhe and, in a participatory process, propose measures for the most discrimination- and racism-
sensitive approach possible within the city. The Office for Cultural Affairs assumes the lead role for RT
ARAD; starting in 2022, the Office for Integration joined on an equal footing.

Karlsruhe Report on the ECCAR Ten-Point Action Plan, the Action Plan against Right-Wing Radicalism,
Racism, Antisemitism, and Discrimination, and the Karlsruhe 2025 Cultural Concept.
The Round Table will work together with civil society actors, the Cultural Office, and the Office for
Integration, and will be supported by the Cultural Committee and the Migration Advisory Board (now the
Integration Committee). The measures include identifying areas of action, developing concrete strategies
to combat racism and discrimination, and developing a sustainable structure for municipal anti-racism
work.

From 2021 to 2023, the RT ARAD met regularly. Nearly 200 people from the city's community – including
the administration, interest groups, civil society organizations, and citizens in a constantly changing
composition – came together for six working meetings. The topics of racism and discrimination were
examined from various perspectives, and a mission statement was jointly developed. The work at the
round table was closely monitored and co-directed by a support group, in which representatives from the
administration and volunteers with expert knowledge (from the RT participants) took up, categorized, and
further developed the content of the round tables.

What specific challenges did you face during the development of the action's concept and which
solutions did you find?
1. A survey of relevant stakeholders prior to the start of the participation process and the corresponding
selection for participation in an initial meeting led to a significant loss of trust within civil society in the
first half of 2021. This situation was gradually addressed and clarified at subsequent meetings, which
introduced an open invitation and a support group with equal representation for the process.
2. At the round table, we worked with different definitions of racism and discrimination and, in the
resulting goals and measures, focused primarily on structural conditions that encourage racism and
discrimination.
3. The lack of a coordinating body within the city administration made cross-internal processes more
difficult.
4. The support group, as a voluntary, unpaid body, lacked a formal mandate, which repeatedly called into
question the legitimacy of this group.
5. Some affected groups were not sufficiently included (see 1.25), which sometimes led to a one-sided
perspective in the process. 6. Some participants participated only irregularly or showed little internal
involvement, which hampered continuous work and exchange.
7. Low participation by managers, especially department heads, posed a challenge due to the lack of key
decision-makers and multipliers.
8. The city is not responsible for many relevant topics identified by civil society, which further complicates
the implementation of concrete measures.
SAC commented:
The SAC notes these extremely important insights with interest.31.05.2025
Mittwoch, 6. August 202515/27

1.16
What resistance did you face during the development of the concept? Both internally (within the
administration and on a political level) and externally (citizenship rights, civil society organisations,
etc.)?
1. It was challenging to adequately address racism and discrimination, as these phenomena are extremely
complex and deeply embedded in social structures. They are also closely linked to personal trauma and
emotional experiences. Individual actors dominated the discussion and emphasized specific experiences
of discrimination. Our approach was to focus on impact areas rather than on discrimination
characteristics. By focusing on specific impact areas—such as education, the labor market, or public
space—we were able to conduct a structured and practical discussion. This makes it possible to visualize
concrete impacts and develop targeted solutions.
2. During the process, we saw that everyone has a different understanding of racism and discrimination,
shaped by their environment, experiences, and socialization. While some participants took strong anti-
Black racism as the basis for their understanding of racism, others preferred to focus more on LGBTQI+
hostility or anti-Muslim hatred. Our approach was to intensively discuss the results of the round tables,
which appealed to a very broad audience, in the expert panel – the advisory group – and to gain diverse
expertise there. The participants in the advisory group largely represented various civil society groups and
were able to contribute in-depth knowledge to the process from personal experience with discrimination
and racism.
3. A key question was who speaks for whom and who has the authority to interpret. It became apparent
that white positions at the round table were partly characterized by defensive attitudes, for example,
statements like: "We are not racist!", "We don't need to change anything!", or "Don't make such a fuss!"
These attitudes made critical engagement with anti-racist perspectives difficult and led to tensions in the
discussion process. Furthermore, there was impatience and a lack of understanding from several sides
regarding the necessary time required for a participatory and sensitive process. The COVID-19 pandemic
further exacerbated the situation by initially making in-person meetings difficult and hindering ongoing
collaboration and exchange between participants.
4. The interaction between administrative staff and civil society experts can often be characterized by
power imbalances. Administrative staff possess institutional authority, while civil society actors contribute
in-depth expertise and practical perspectives. This asymmetry can lead to misunderstandings and an
unequal distribution of influence. One solution lies in the concept of meaningful partnerships based on
equality, mutual recognition, and shared responsibility. Through transparent communication, shared
decision-making processes, and structural support, productive collaboration can emerge that has a lasting
impact. Administrative staff have demonstrated their willingness to reflect on their own position in some
cases.
SAC commented:
Thank you for these extremely interesting insights into the process
and its conditions. The SAC welcomes the approach of focusing on
topics and rights rather then so called discrimination grounds.
However, the experience of persons discriminated against puts the
indignification in the foreground. Therefore it is sometimes necessary
to focus on these specific characteristics. What concerns the
definition of racism and discrimination, the SAC recommends
referring to the human rights clause which outlaws any distinction,
restriction, exclusion or preference in the enjoyments of human rights
on any ground.

Other, namely:
City subsidiaries and other administrative staff and managers
1.19
What were the three main arguments for engaging these stakeholders / cooperation partners?
The primary reason for involving civil society actors, city subsidiaries, municipal council members, and
administrative staff was the desire for the broadest and most diverse perspectives and expertise possible.
Civil society actors contribute practical experience and the perspectives of those affected, while
administrative staff have insights into political and bureaucratic processes and the city's subsidiaries (e.g.,
housing associations, public transport companies) and play a central role in the implementation of anti-
racist measures in everyday life. The targeted involvement of municipal council members ensures political
feedback and commitment. Furthermore, it was important to create greater visibility for the experiences
within the city through the process itself and to generate empathy through exchange. The participatory
approach strengthens trust in municipal structures and demonstrates that anti-racism and anti-
discrimination work is a shared concern. Affected and committed citizens are taken seriously and actively
involved in decision-making processes. Last but not least, the involvement of as many different actors as
possible should also ensure the binding nature and traceability of municipal anti-discrimination work and
thus enable the strengthening of local democracy and participation.

1.22
What specific challenges did you face during planning and while engaging stakeholders, and which
solutions did you find?
At the beginning of the project, several COVID-19 restrictions still had to be observed, which generally
made in-person meetings difficult. The first meeting was nevertheless able to take place in person, and a
meeting in January 2022 took place online. Stakeholder engagement was made more difficult, on the one
hand, by the diverse opinions of civil society, which had to be appreciated in all their diversity, and on the
other hand, by the desire to formulate clear goals and measures, some of which were very specific. For
example, a central demand in the "Community Building" field of activity was the call for safe spaces open
only to certain communities, also to protect them from attacks. At the same time, the same group called for
open exchange to enable and promote contact between different groups. Reconciling these diverse wishes
and demands was a challenge. Our solution was to formulate guidelines that should be considered for all
goals and measures, in addition to the various concrete demands in the individual areas of impact:
1. Nothing about us without us:
Civil society, representatives of those affected, and municipal stakeholders are involved as important
partners in the planning, implementation, and evaluation of the goals and measures.
2. Focus on needs:
Both the process and the resulting results focus on the interests and needs of those people who are
devalued and marginalized by racism and discrimination.
3. Representation makes a difference:
In key decisions, it must become normal for diverse people to be involved, and previously
underrepresented groups must be given equal opportunities to participate in political, economic, and
social life.
At the beginning of the process, there was a strong desire within the administration to work with only a
few, relatively "uncomplicated" stakeholders in order to make the process as smooth as possible. Only later
did a gradual opening towards broader participation take place. The challenge was to reach potential
stakeholders and win them over to the process in the long term. Another key question was who spoke for
whom – both within the administration and from the communities. It became clear that there were
different perspectives and power relations that influenced the discussion process. Another area of tension
arose from the discrepancy between volunteer work and professional participation: While some
stakeholders were able to contribute during their working hours, for others it involved additional, unpaid
effort. This led to unequal conditions and affected the continuity of participation.

What were the most important drivers and leverages in relation to your action?
Mittwoch, 6. August 202518/27

The most important drivers and levers for the approach were the realization that cooperation between civil
society actors, the administration, and subsidiaries is required to implement long-term and networked anti
-racism and diversity-sensitive processes in the city. Even though various actors in the process assessed the
need for different approaches differently, there was a general concern to draw more attention to the topic of
anti-discrimination and anti-racism in general. The participants in the roundtable shared a common vision
– a world free of racism and discrimination. The recognition that Germany is a pluralistic, linguistically
and culturally diverse migrant society shaped the discussions and the corresponding realization that we
all consciously and unconsciously contribute to structures that perpetuate racist and discriminatory
behavior. At the same time, however, it also nurtured the realization that if we work together to dismantle
and break down racism and discrimination, we can create a livable and just city for all. A key aspect of the
process is the need for an effective and central organizational unit responsible for the implementation and
further development of the position paper and the ARAD strategy. This unit must be equipped with a clear
and robust mandate to act decisively, steer the process over the long term, and effectively implement
measures.

In 2024, on behalf of the municipal council, we compared four strategic papers from the city of Karlsruhe
in a multi-stage, internal process: the position paper on municipal anti-racism and anti-discrimination
work (ARAD), the Karlsruhe Integration Plan, the internationalization strategy, and the concept for
implementing the Istanbul Convention. We identified that anti-discrimination work in Karlsruhe has so far
often been target group-specific and that more comprehensive, structurally effective strategies are needed.
While the Integration Plan and the ARAD position paper address similar areas of action in the areas of
integration and anti-discrimination, the papers differ significantly in their origins, management, and
target group focus. The ARAD position paper calls for a whole-of-society approach to combating racism
and discrimination. Recommendations include strengthening cooperation between the city administration
and civil society, establishing a board of trustees to evaluate measures, and ensuring sustainable financial
and human resources for the continuation of anti-discrimination work, ideally in a staff unit affiliated with
the mayor.
2025 – Conceptual work on the structure of the unit and further round table meetings to keep stakeholders
on board and continue to engage them.
Despite the difficult budget situation and the changing political majority in the municipal council, internal
coordination on the further development of anti-discrimination work will continue. In parallel, work is
underway on the conceptual design of the operational unit. To closely involve civil society and maintain
the motivation of those involved, two more roundtable meetings are planned this year.
SAC commented:
The SAC welcomes the detailed report. The SAC notes with
appreciation that the ARAD paper seems the most comprehensive and
advanced compared to the other important human rights documents
at local level. The approach is noted with interest by the SAC.

How did you access the target group?
Mittwoch, 6. August 202520/27

The target group was reached through a multi-stage approach. Invitations to the roundtables were
gradually expanded, following a snowball system, so that the circle of participants steadily grew. In
addition, stakeholders from the administration and urban society were specifically invited to individual
meetings to incorporate their perspectives into the process. The formation of a support group of key
multipliers also played a central role. This panel of experts discussed the results of the roundtables in
depth and contributed diverse professional and personal perspectives. The members of the support group
represented various civil society groups and often had their own experiences of discrimination, which
enabled them to contribute in-depth and practical expertise to the process. This ensured that both a broad
public and specific specialist knowledge were systematically involved in the strategy development.
Unfortunately, we were unable to recruit stakeholders in the area of anti-Asian racism and antigypsyism. In
the area of anti-Semitism, some affected people participated occasionally, but there was no continuous
participation that would serve the overall cause. In the area of anti-Black racism, too, we failed to motivate
enough affected people (as a percentage of the numerical number of potentially affected people) to
continue to participate. Here, we would have relied on more self-organization among those affected and
better communication opportunities within the communities.

Public relations: how did you make your action visible in the city?
This action was publicized on the city's website and in the reporting on the municipal council's decision
on the results of the round table, but given the importance of the issue, we certainly did not manage to
communicate it to the public sufficiently. This was due, on the one hand, to the complexity of the structure
and the issue, and, on the other, to the fact that these are currently primarily declarations of intent, the
nature and scope of which are not yet sufficiently clear. The fact that the process-based nature of the round
table also relies on a certain degree of commitment and continuity of participation was also a hurdle for an
overly unrestricted solicitation of participation in the round table. This not entirely satisfactory public
perception of the RT ARAD's work must be improved through targeted public relations work when
implementing the first concrete milestones at the beginning of 2026. "Public relations campaigns" was also
defined as the first area of activity in the position paper.
1.27
What specific challenges did you face when putting your action into practice and during the daily work,
and which solutions did you find?
Mittwoch, 6. August 202521/27

In our daily work, we faced several challenges: First, the varying degrees of personal exposure to racism
and discrimination, which led to different perspectives and a host of emotions during the process. Second,
the breadth of the issue – rather than focusing on a single discriminatory characteristic, it was important
to address racism and discrimination in all its complexity. Third, limited resources, particularly the
unequal distribution of time and financial resources between permanent staff and volunteers, posed a
challenge.
Solutions included and continue to include creating spaces for reflection and exchange to consider
different levels of exposure, strengthening intersectional approaches, and seeking ways to better support
volunteer work.
The people personally affected by racism and discrimination who were involved in and for RT ARAD
understandably wanted rapid and effective results to improve the situation in their communities. The
requesting parliamentary groups on the municipal council also wanted rapid and significant progress and
clear recommendations for action. This represented a difficult conflict of objectives with the mandate,
which, encompassing the entire field of discrimination and racism, had an immense scope and contained
many intersectional entanglements and potential contradictions that had to be considered and negotiated.
Our desire, fundamentally shared by all actors, to think through this matter jointly and systematically, to
involve and truly engage as many stakeholders as possible, as well as the desire to allow a voice not only to
those who do most of the talking anyway, naturally slowed and complicated this process, making it more
costly and slower to support and implement. The more impatience and debates grew regarding the scarce
resources for this task, the greater the discrepancy became between the expectations of the (often full-
time) "professionals" and the possibilities and capacities of the often also "professionals" who carried out
the work at and for the RT ARAD, and especially in the support group, in their "free time," often alongside
demanding professional activities and other civil society engagements. This also exacerbated the latent,
always resonant question of “equal eye level.”
1.28
Which impact and outcomes were achieved by the action?
The Round Table, as a participatory format, was a milestone and a central component of the intensified
municipal anti-racism and anti-discrimination work in Karlsruhe. It brought together key stakeholders
from the administration, city-related institutions and subsidiaries, as well as civil society, for the first time
in an organized manner to jointly develop a guiding principle for a discrimination-sensitive and anti-
racism urban society. It is not the end, but the beginning of joint efforts and activities.
The process had various goals and effects.
1. Create a common understanding: The Round Table was and will continue to facilitate the exchange of
ideas about racism and discrimination and promote awareness of structural inequalities. The process also
aimed to define key terms and sharpen a common stance.
2. Identify needs and challenges: The Round Table served to collect and analyze experiences, perspectives,
and existing challenges in various areas of life and, by involving affected groups and experts, to develop
practical solutions.
3. Strengthening participation and co-determination: A central concern of the process was to promote
cooperation between administration, politics, and civil society and to ensure that people with experiences
of racism and discrimination are actively involved in decision-making processes.
4. Development of measures: The round table was intended to develop recommendations for action for
politics and administration. Prioritization and allocation of responsibilities for implementing the measures
were also to take place.
The effects of the participation process are diverse:
Mittwoch, 6. August 202522/27

1. Expansion of the dialogue format: The round table established itself as a sustainable forum for exchange
and cooperation between various stakeholders.
2. Sustainable integration of anti-racist work: The participatory approach structurally strengthened anti-
discrimination work and emphasized institutional responsibility.
3. Transparency and connectivity: The integration of existing strategies (e.g., Integration Plan, Istanbul
Convention) demonstrated the connectivity to existing measures.
The result of the participatory process is a position paper on municipal anti-racism and anti-
discrimination work. The aim of this paper is to present the framework, goals, and measures on which the
participants have jointly agreed.
A central concern of the position paper is the establishment of a coordination office, which must be
equipped with a robust mandate. This office should ensure the sustainable implementation of the
measures, coordinate the various actors, and provide resources for continuing education and training, as
well as for the implementation of impact-related work. Only through clear institutional anchoring and
recognition of the importance of this task by the administrative leadership and the municipal council can
the goals formulated in the paper be achieved in the long term.
The position paper is divided into two main parts: The first part analyzes in detail the effects of structural
and institutional racism and discrimination and shows how the city administration can perpetuate or
reproduce discriminatory practices through its structures. The second part describes eight key areas of
impact that define concrete goals and time-bound measures to combat racism and discrimination. These
measures are intended to initiate structural changes and distribute responsibility among various levels of
administration and urban society.
Three guiding principles form the basis of municipal anti-racism and anti-discrimination work:
1. Nothing about us without us – The perspectives and experiences of affected groups must be actively
included, and their participation ensured.
2. Focus on needs – Measures are geared to the concrete needs and realities of marginalized people.
3. Representation makes a difference – The visibility and participation of people with experience of racism
in decision-making processes must be ensured.
These guiding principles underscore the need to strengthen cooperation with civil society and ensure that
those affected are actively involved in the development and implementation of anti-racist and anti-
discriminatory concepts.

What made your action successful? Please outline the 3 key factors of success
Mittwoch, 6. August 202524/27

The results of the final evaluation reveal three success factors for this campaign:
1. Establishment of a sustainable dialogue format
The roundtable has proven to be an effective forum for raising awareness of racism and discrimination. The
high willingness (72% of respondents) to continue participating demonstrates the strong interest and
relevance of the format. Furthermore, a majority of respondents (82%) felt that they had learned something
new through their participation and were able to form important partnerships.
2. Positive evaluation of the position paper and desire for continuous information
The developed position paper was received positively overall. Furthermore, the majority (85%) would like a
digital communication platform to stay informed about anti-racism and anti-discrimination work.
3. Needs assessment for the further development of the strategy
The roundtables have provided important impetus for further development. These include the need for a
clearer allocation of responsibilities, greater transparency regarding costs, and the expansion of the format
to include additional areas of impact, as well as even greater participation by migrant organizations.

Please outline 3 lessons learnt
The three most important findings from the survey are:
1. The roundtable is an effective format for raising awareness of racism and discrimination. Establishing a
sustainable dialogue format between administrative units and civil society organizations can lead to a
mutual understanding of challenges.
2. The position paper was overall positively evaluated, although there was criticism regarding the lack of
specific responsibilities and measures, as well as the lack of transparency regarding costs and resources. A
subsequent non-representative survey of students who examined the position paper in a university
seminar reached the same conclusion.
3. Information and exchange in the digital space, e.g., via a website or newsletter, is desired. Reliable
reporting with regular updates on the implementation of the position paper is also required.

What makes your action sustainable?
Mittwoch, 6. August 202525/27

The results will feed into the work of the future Operational Unit, which will be responsible for
coordinating and implementing the anti-racism and anti-discrimination strategy starting in 2026.
The participation process thus demonstrated that a sustainable and effective anti-racism strategy is only
possible through close cooperation between administration, politics, and civil society.
The creation of a written position paper, in particular, demonstrates a long-term orientation and
institutional anchoring of anti-racism and anti-discrimination work. By outlining responsibilities and
developing measures, as well as involving civil society, a lasting process of change is initiated. However,
this process requires further steps to actually have a concrete impact.
The anchoring of the three central guiding principles in all municipal processes ensures that – if these
principles are actually implemented – anti-racist perspectives are continuously taken into account.
Furthermore, if it actually comes to fruition, the establishment of an operational unit starting in 2026 will
ensure that the process does not end with the publication of the position paper, but is continuously
continued and adapted to new challenges.
As part of the process, existing strategic documents of the city, such as the Integration Plan and the
implementation of the Istanbul Convention, were also evaluated. This made it possible to identify
interfaces and priorities and to integrate the developed measures into existing structures. This ensures that
anti-racist and anti-discriminatory work does not remain isolated but is embedded in the overarching
municipal strategies.

What were the most important challenges during the evaluation and impact assessment of your action,
and which solutions did you find?
Mittwoch, 6. August 202526/27

Collaboration in the field of anti-racism and anti-discrimination often unfolds its impact in small,
continuous steps – through shared learning, raising awareness, and the gradual integration of anti-
discrimination perspectives into administrative action. At the same time, this work is currently facing
significant challenges: In a social climate in which anti-discrimination work is increasingly under
pressure, and under conditions of increasingly scarce resources, it is difficult to assess whether political
will and institutional structures are sufficient to consistently support complex participation processes –
even in the face of internal resistance.
A key consequence would be: If the recommendations and ideas developed within the framework of the
round table remain without visible implementation, there is a risk of a loss of trust in municipal structures.
The willingness of civil society actors to continue to participate could noticeably decrease – especially if
participation is perceived as inconsequential or purely symbolic. This would not only result in the loss of a
valuable space for dialogue, but also a crucial resource in the fight against structural discrimination: the
commitment and expertise of the city's own society.
Conversely, consistent implementation of the recommendations can send a strong signal: It demonstrates
that participation is taken seriously and that the city is willing to initiate structural changes – even under
difficult conditions. This can strengthen trust in democratic processes, enable new alliances, and
contribute to positioning Karlsruhe in the long term as a learning, anti-discrimination, and inclusive
municipality.
