INTERNATIONAL 
 PROFESSIONALS 
The Karlsruhe TechnologyRegion is one of the strongest 
economic regions in Europe. We intend to retain and conti-
nue to build on this leading position, focusing increasingly 
on the great potential offered by international professionals. 
Our region is home to a mix of multinationals, world 
 leading scienti c institutions, SMEs and start-ups, along 
with a well-balanced cross-section of sectors with a high 
proportion of next-generation technologies. The focus 
of TechnologieRegion Karlsruhe GmbH’s work is on the 
themes of mobility, energy and digitalisation. 
Our region is a growth area and is creating jobs. However 
many of these are already proving dif cult to  ll: the skills 
shortage in many sectors has become one of the most 
 urgent challenges facing businesses here. Meeting the 
 demand for skilled professionals is therefore one of TRK 
GmbH’s most important tasks for the future and is an 
 important pillar in its work.
Leading the  eld in technology 
and innovation: Bene t from the 
 competences and the synergies 
of TRK GmbH
